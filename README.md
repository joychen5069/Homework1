# Homework1

# html edits
I attempted to clean up the code for the homework. I took several different <div> tags in the html and renamed them to increase readability. I fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link at the top to automatically scroll to the "Search Engine Optimization" paragraph. 

I also added notes to both the html and css to help guide what it is they do. 

# css edits
I grouped together several different tags that had the same style in order to clean up the code. I also reorganized the order the style sheet was in so that it matched the HTML order.
